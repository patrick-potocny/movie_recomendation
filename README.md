# Movie recomendation engine
This project is aimed at utilizing NLP in python to develop content based movie recommendation engine. As the source of movies, I used https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata .  The engine creates similarity matrix based on cast, director and short text overview of the movie, then it returns 5 most similar movies to the one you input. In the end, i also created a sqlite3 database file with all movies with their recommendations.
